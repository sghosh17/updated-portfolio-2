## Week 02 Homework

This project involves creating a portfolio web page using the HTML and CSS elements. As part of creating the webpage, I have done the following steps :

* Created a header and navigation as per the mock-up

* Created an empty section with a background image and sub title

* Created sub sections for About Me, Work and Contact Me

* Each nav link goes to the relevant section

* In the work section, I have used placeholder images and header and the images do not link anywhere since I dont have LIVE applications.

* The code is responsive amd so it will align and format correctly on different devices.
